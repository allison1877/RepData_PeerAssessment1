This is an R Markdown document for Week 2 in Reproducible Research using the activity data.

### **1. Code for reading in the dataset and/or processing the data**  
Steps:  
  - Set working directory  
  - Read in the data  
  - Check columns and update format of date column  
  - Print first six rows to check data  
      
```{r, echo=TRUE}
    setwd("C:/Users/Allison.Moore/Desktop/Coursera/RepData_PeerAssessment1/activity/")
    activity <- read.csv("activity.csv", header = TRUE)
    str(activity$date)
    activity$date <- as.POSIXct(strptime(activity$date, "%Y-%m-%d"))
    
    head(activity)
```

### **2. Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day**  

Calculate the sum of steps per day and graph that using a histogram

```{r, echo=TRUE}
steps_sum <- tapply(activity$steps, activity$date, FUN=sum, na.rm = TRUE)
hist(steps_sum, main = "Histogram of Total Steps", xlab = "Sum of Steps", col = "lightblue")

```

### **3. Mean and median number of steps taken each day**  

Look at the overall mean and median for steps
```{r, echo=TRUE}
    mean(activity$steps, na.rm = TRUE)
    median(activity$steps, na.rm = TRUE)
```

Calculate the mean and median by date and output

```{r, echo=TRUE}
    steps_mean <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data = activity, FUN=mean, na.rm=TRUE)
    steps_median <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data = activity, FUN=median, na.rm=TRUE)
    
        steps_summary <- merge(x = steps_mean, y = steps_median, by = c("date", "date"))
        colnames(steps_summary) <- c("Date", "Mean Steps", "Median Steps")
        print(steps_summary)
```

### **4.Time series plot of the average number of steps taken**
```{r, echo=TRUE}
  avg_steps <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, data = activity, FUN=mean, na.rm = TRUE)
   with(avg_steps, plot(interval, steps, type = "l", 
                        main = "Average Number of Steps Taken Across All Days",
                        xlab = "5-Minute Interval", ylab = "Average Steps"))
```

### **5. The 5-minute interval that, on average, contains the maximum number of steps**

This will output the row it occurs, the interval, and the maximum steps
```{r, echo=TRUE}
  avg_steps[which.max(avg_steps$steps), ]
```

### **6. Code to describe and show a strategy for imputing missing data**  

Results:  
- The overall mean did not change because we imputed with the column mean  
- The overall median did not change either because there were only 2304 missing values and this was not enough to change the median  
- Some of the by day means and medians changed  
- The histograms changed  
- Overall: Change to graphs of data but little impact to overall summary statistics because imputated data only accounted for 13% of data  

Number of missing values in the dataset
```{r, echo=TRUE}
sum(!complete.cases(activity))
```

Fill in the missing values with the overall mean and show the new file
```{r, echo=TRUE}
activity$steps[is.na(activity$steps)] = mean(activity$steps, na.rm = TRUE)
head(activity, 10)
```

Using the new data - Look at the overall mean and median for steps
```{r, echo=TRUE}
    mean(activity$steps, na.rm = TRUE)
    median(activity$steps, na.rm = TRUE)
```

Using the new data - Calculate the mean and median by date 

```{r, echo=TRUE}
    steps_mean <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data = activity, FUN=mean, na.rm=TRUE)
    steps_median <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data = activity, FUN=median, na.rm=TRUE)
    
        steps_summary <- merge(x = steps_mean, y = steps_median, by = c("date", "date"))
        colnames(steps_summary) <- c("Date", "Mean Steps", "Median Steps")
        print(steps_summary)
```

### **7. Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day after missing values are imputed**

Using the new data - Calculate the sum of steps per day and graph that using a histogram.  This should be different from the previous histogram.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
steps_sum <- tapply(activity$steps, activity$date, FUN=sum, na.rm = TRUE)
hist(steps_sum, main = "Histogram of Total Steps with Imputation", xlab = "Sum of Steps ", col= "blue")

```

### **8.  Panel plot comparing the average number of steps taken per 5-minute interval across weekdays and weekends**
Steps:  
- Create a new factor for weekday or weekend  
- Make a panel plot
```{r, echo=TRUE}
activity$daytype <- ifelse(weekdays(activity$date) %in% c("Saturday", "Sunday"), "Weekend", "Weekday")
head(activity)
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
  avg_steps2 <- aggregate(steps ~ interval + daytype, data = activity, FUN=mean, na.rm = TRUE)

library(lattice)
xyplot(avg_steps2$steps ~ avg_steps2$interval | avg_steps2$daytype, type = "l",
      xlab = "Interval", ylab = "Number of Steps", col = "blue")
```
